              The cafe was designed as a "home away from home," built around a
              warm, family-like atmosphere where the owners are present daily,
              living the cafe and creating a genuine sense of care. A strong
              emphasis is placed on high-quality food, prepared with attention
              and consistency.

              Our role as a marketing agency was to define these core values
              and then translate this feeling into social media, ensuring the
              cafe's warmth, authenticity, and human presence are felt both
              online and in person.

                When we began, it became clear that a key foundation was
                missing: a brand book. As this is essential for building a
                consistent brand, we focused on creating it from scratch.
              </p>
              <p>
                We started with a brand analysis and an in-depth interview with
                the owner to understand the café’s vision, long-term direction,
                and existing assets. Based on these insights, we defined a
                clear brand strategy aligned with the café’s identity and
                future goals.
              </p>
              <p>
                We then developed a logotype optimised for digital use,
                particularly across social media. The brand book outlined
                guidelines for logo usage, colour palette, and typography,
                ensuring consistency across all touchpoints. Finally, we
                translated this framework into practical digital assets to
                support clear and cohesive communication on social platforms.
